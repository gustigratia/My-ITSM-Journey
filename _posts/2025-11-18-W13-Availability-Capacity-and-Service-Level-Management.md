## Week 13 — Availability, Capacity, and Service Level Management

In the Week 13 class activity, I studied, summarized, and explained the core concepts of four key ITIL practices. This included definitions, purposes, main processes, KPIs, and examples of how each practice is applied. All answers were compiled into my Week 13 document.

# A. Availability Management

## 1. Definition & Purpose
Availability Management ensures that IT services are available at the agreed levels so that users can rely on them when needed. Its main focus is maintaining service stability and reliability to support business value.

## 2. Key Activities
The activities I highlighted include:

- Setting realistic availability targets  
- Designing infrastructure that supports high availability  
- Collecting and analyzing performance data  
- Continuous service monitoring  
- Implementing improvements to increase availability  

## 3. KPIs
Some KPIs I recorded include:

- User outage minutes  
- Lost transactions  
- Lost business value  
- User satisfaction score  

## 4. MTBF & MTRS
I explained two critical metrics:

- **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):** Average time between service failures  
- **MTRS (Mean Time to Restore Service):** Average time needed to recover service after failure

# B. Capacity & Performance Management

## 1. Definition
Capacity & Performance Management ensures that IT services have sufficient capacity and performance to meet current and future business needs in a cost-effective manner.

## 2. Key Activities
I divided the activities into two major areas:

### **Service Performance & Capacity Analysis**
- Performance monitoring  
- Usage trend analysis and modelling  
- Performance risk assessment  

### **Service Performance & Capacity Planning**
- Forecasting capacity requirements  
- Resource planning  
- Developing performance improvement plans  

## 3. KPIs
Some KPIs I listed include:

- CPU, memory, and storage utilization  
- Network throughput  
- Response time  
- Bottlenecks and capacity shortfalls  
- Forecasting accuracy  
- Transaction rates  

## 4. Contribution to the Service Value Chain
I explained how this practice supports multiple SVS activities:

- **Plan:** Provides data for strategic decisions  
- **Improve:** Identifies performance issues and improvement opportunities  
- **Engage:** Helps set realistic expectations with customers  
- **Design & Transition:** Ensures new services have sufficient capacity  
- **Obtain/Build:** Supports resource acquisition  
- **Deliver & Support:** Ensures stable and high-performing services

# C. Service Level Management (SLM)

## 1. Definition
Service Level Management focuses on defining clear, measurable service quality targets through service levels and SLAs, and ensuring that services consistently meet those targets.

## 2. Key Processes
In my explanation, SLM activities include:

- Establishing a shared understanding between provider and customer  
- Ensuring services meet agreed quality levels  
- Conducting regular service reviews  
- Capturing and reporting service issues  

## 3. KPIs
I organized the KPIs into four categories:

- **Customer engagement metrics**  
- **Customer feedback**  
- **Operational metrics** such as availability and response time  
- **Business metrics**  

## 4. SLA & Key Requirements
I explained that SLAs must:

- Be linked to real services in the service catalogue  
- Focus on outcomes, not just technical metrics  
- Be built through provider–customer discussions  
- Be simple, clear, and easy to understand

# D. Service Catalogue Management

## 1. Definition
Service Catalogue Management provides a single, consistent source of information about all live and available services that customers can use.

## 2. Purpose
In my summary, the service catalogue aims to:

- Provide accurate and clear information about services  
- Serve as a single source of truth  
- Keep service data up to date  
- Support communication between provider and customer  

## 3. Example Services
I included two example services in a catalogue:

- **Student Email**  
- **Campus Internet Connection**  

Both were described with their function and purpose.

## 4. Comparison of the Two Services
I compared the two services based on characteristics:

- **Student Email** requires a request process  
- **Campus Internet Connection** is an immediate service that does not require a request

# Reflection
Through Week 13, I gained a deeper understanding of how availability, capacity, and service levels must be consistently planned, monitored, and measured to maintain high-quality IT services. Summarizing these practices helped me see how they play a significant role in ensuring stability, scalability, and user satisfaction across the IT service lifecycle.
